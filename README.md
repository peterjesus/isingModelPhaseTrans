# isingModelPhaseTrans

Numerical Analysis of Phase transition in the 2D-Ising model

## Prerequisites

It is needed to previously install:

* https://github.com/fortran-lang

## Introduction

This repo contains a script for calculating several quantities related with the 2D-Ising model and study its Phase Transition. This work is done as an Assignment in the Condensed Matter Theory course of the Physics MSc at the University of Ulm (2016/2017)

The tasks covered with this code and gathered in the .dat files are:

* Calculate E/J and M for each spin configuration
* For each M, calculate Z and F(M,T)/J 
* Plot F(M) for each value of T
